Here comes dat gameboi
======================
LELmark edition
--------------

LELmark is a fork (right now a branch) of Here comes dat gameboi that plays (not yet) games byt itself. So far the plan is to make a couple of Game specific AI to play some games.

TODO list
=========

 - [ ] Savestates
 - [ ] Figure out how the read from the game what piece is falling and which one is the next
 - [ ] Read from the game the actual position of the piece instead of reading from the OAM
 - [ ] ???

What is working
===============

 - Reading the placed blocks
 - Reading of the faling pieces
  - Just 4 small blocks, not the piece as a whole
 - 5 different metrics to evaluate where the piece will go
